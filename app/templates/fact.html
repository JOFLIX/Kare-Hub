<h1>Cancer Facts</h1>
<h2>What is cancer and what courses it</h2>
<p>Cancer is a collection of over 200 diseases in which cells of an organ or tissue in the body become abnormal, growing and multiplying out of control.</p>
<p>Cancer is NOT caused by witchcraft or any form of supernatural force. Cancer is a disease that can affect anyone, anywhere, in any country, at anytime.  Cancer is a complex group of diseases with many possible causes</p>

<!-- <h2>Posssible courses of cancer</h2>
<ul>
<li> Age:</li>
<p>The older you are, the more likely that you will develop a cancer. This is probably due to a build up of damage to cells in the body over time. Also, the body’s defences and resistance against abnormal cells may become weaker as you get older.</p>
<li>Immune System</li>
<p>Those with a compromised immune system have an increased risk of developing certain cancers. E.g. people with HIV/AIDS, or people on immunosuppressive treatment</p>
<li>Environmental exposures to different types of chemicals and radiation.</li>
<li>Certain types of infections</li>
<p>Some viruses are linked to certain cancers. E.g. those with persistent infection with the Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C virus have an increased risk of developing cancer of the liver.</p>
<li>Lifestyle factors such as tobacco use, diet, physical inactivity</li>
<li>Genetic factors</li>
</ul> -->

<!-- <h2>What lifestyle choices can I make to help me fight Cancer?</h2> -->


<!-- <ol>


    <li>Get regular physical activity.</li>

    <li>Drink plenty of water.</li>

    <li>Get 10-15 minutes of sunshine a day</li>

    <li>Do, eat, live everything in moderation.  Reduce stress.</li>

    <li>Allow yourself 8 hours of sleep at night for optimum rest.</li>

    <p>Eat a balanced diet</p>

    <li>Eat in moderation.</li>

    <li>Eat a healthy diet, with a variety of fruits and vegetables.</li>

    <li>Eat food as close as possible to its natural form</li>

    <li>Limit your intake of processed foods</li>
</ol> -->

<!-- <h2>What are some signs and symptoms of Cancer?</h2> -->
<!-- <p>You cannot afford to ignore cancer.  Instead, you should know some of the general signs and symptoms of cancer.</p>
<p>But remember, having any of these does not mean that you have cancer—many other things cause these signs and symptoms, too.</p> -->

<h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
<ol>
<li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
<li>Prolonged fever</li>
<li>Prolonged, unexplained pain</li>
<li>Skin changes</li>
<li>Change in bowel habits or bladder function</li>
<li>Sores that do not heal</li>
<li>White patches inside the mouth or white spots on the tongue</li>
<li>Unusual vaginal bleeding or discharge</li>
<li>Thickening or lump in the breast or other parts of the body</li>
<li>Any new skin change</li>

</ol>
<h2>How is Cancer diagnosed?</h2>
<p>If a cancer is suspected from your symptoms:</p>
<p>1.Your doctor will examine you to look for abnormalities such as a lump under the skin or an enlarged liver. </p>
<p>You may be referred for tests such as X-rays, scan, blood tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, bronchoscopy, etc depending on where the suspected cancer is situated. These tests can often find the exact site of a suspected cancer. However, a biopsy** is often needed to be certain that the abnormality is a cancer and not something else (such as a benign tumour).</p>

<h2>What are the treatment options for Cancer?</h2>
<p>Treatment options vary, depending on the type of cancer and how far it has grown or spread. The three most common treatments are:</p>
<ul>

<li>Surgery</li>
<p>It may be possible to operate and remove malignant turmours.</p>
<li>Chemotherapy</li>
<p>This is a treatment that uses anti-cancer drugs to kill cancer cells, or to stop them from multiplying. There are various different types of drugs used for chemotherapy. The drug or combination of drugs selected depends on the type of cancer being treated.</p>
<li>Radiotherapy</li>
<p>This is a treatment that uses high energy beams of radiation which are focused on cancerous tissue. This kills cancer cells, or stops cancer cells from multiplying.</p>
<li>Bone Marrow Transplant</li>
  <p>High dose chemotherapy may damage bone marrow cells and lead to blood problems. However, if you receive healthy bone marrow after the chemotherapy then this helps to overcome this problem.</p>
  <li>Hormone therapy: </li>
  <p>This is where drugs are used to block the effects of hormones. This treatment may be used for cancers that are “hormone sensitive” such as some cancers of the breast, prostate and uterus.</p>
  <li>Immunotherapy: </li>
  <p>Some treatments can boost the immune system to help to fight cancer. More specific immunotherapy involves injections of antibodies which aim to attack and destroy certain types of cancer cells.</p>
  <li>Gene therapy </li>
  <p>Is a new area of possible treatments. Research is underway to find ways of blocking, repairing or replacing abnormal genes in cancer cells.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Some questions you may want to ask your doctor</h2>
<ol>
<li>What kind of cancer have I got?</li>
<li>How large is it and has it spread to other parts of my body?</li>
<li>What are the treatment options for this type of cancer?</li>
<li>What are the risks and possible side effects of the treatment options?</li>
<li>How successful is the treatment for my type and stage of cancer?</li>
<li>s the aim of treatment to cure or to control the cancer?</li>
    <li>What if I choose not to have treatment?</li>
    <li>Can I have a second opinion?</li>
</ol>
